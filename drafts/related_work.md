## State-of-the art 
1. End-to-end deep learning architecture (YOLO, Faster RCNN, GoogleNet)
2. CNN
3. Non-rigid part model with unsupervised feature learning
4. Feature-based tracking
5. Color based object recognition
6. Optical Flow tracking using stereo camera
7. Background subtraction & saliency based tracking
8. Deformable Multiple Kernels HOG tracking for moving camera

## Problem with existing solutions
1. Deep learning approach requires large amount of data 
2. Color based recognition proned to environmental factors
3. Feature-based tracking high computational costs for real time application
4. Not easily adaptable to different environments i.e shallow pool and deep ocean
