# Contributions
1. General underwater object detection and tracking framework that works consistently in different
water bodies.
2. Low detection latency that enables AUV to perform manipulation task underwater
3. Provide useful information for mission planning such as distance, scale etc.
4. Dynamic camera parameters tuning based on natural image statistics
5. Simulation of different perturbed underwater conditions for ease of testing
6. Leverage on small datasets that are noisy and unlabeled
