# Problem
Detection and Tracking underwater objects in different environments

## Nature of problem
 - static rigid object
 - partial occlusion because of swimmers or other obstacles
 - low contrast
 - color degradation
 - non-uniform illumination. flickering patterns
 - shadow
 - multiple object tracking
 - detection latency must be small
 - geometry of objects are made known
 - very small objects

## Why is this problem interesting ?
 - underwater object inspection
 - underwater marine animals research
 - search and rescue
 - ease of use by non-technical people to utilize AUVs
 - save costs of expensive sensors such as sonar, stereo camera etc.
 - reduce post-processing after each mission and enable real time application
