# Methodology

## Project Pipeline
1. Preprocessing
 - noise removal
 - color constancy 
 - contrast enhancement
 - flicker and shadow removal
2. Training
 - unsupervised training on unlabelled datasets
 - training on labelled datasets
 - online training
3. Object Detection
 - detection proposal
4. Object Tracking

## Ideas
1. Using global and local context
2. Combining deep learning and feature learning
3. Transfer learning on large dataset
4. Zero-shot learning with small amount of datasets
5. Better object proposal algorithm
6. Saliency mechanism
7. Operate on superpixel
8. Preprocess on demand 
9. Using temporal cue to remove false positive (optical flow)
10. Explore different color descriptor that are invariant
11. Automatic algorithm or feature selection 
12. Negative samples learning
13. Explore clustering and segmentation as preprocessing step
14. Reasoning and working memory
